\chapter{Find and cut out domains}
I downloaded the \texttt{FASTA} from \emph{UniProt.org} with the identifier
\textbf{Q62936-1}. I sliced the three PDZ domains from the original sequence, and saved them into the corresponding \texttt{PDZ1}, \texttt{PDZ2}, \texttt{PDZ3} file available at the repository.
